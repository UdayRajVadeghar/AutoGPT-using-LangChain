# AutoGPT-using-LangChain

In this project I have used LangChain to take the help of other GPT tools and create your own GPT.

Requirements:-
1)Lower Versions of python won't support this project , make sure to have atleast v 3.11 or plus
2) Install the Latest version of VS-code 
3) Install all the necessory tools from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
3) Pip install streamlit langchain openai chromadb wikipedia tiktoken
Copy and paste "Pip install streamlit langchain openai chromadb wikipedia tiktoken" in a single line
4)Get your ApiKey from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
You're set and ready to go.

Steps to implement are: 

1)create a VS file
2)Add new file named app.py
3)Copy down the code which I have provided in the repo
4)create another file named apikey.py
5)Copy and paste your Apikey 
6)Run the code
7)After the code has been sucessfully ran open the terminal and type "streamlit run app.py"
8)This will connect you to the service using chramadb and open your default browser where in you can ask anything
9)Note: I have already set the promts , so you will be only able to see the title and 10 advantages of the given topic.
10)To change that , you can edit the promt of your own in the code.
